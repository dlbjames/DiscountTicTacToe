# DiscountTicTacToe
A programming challenge I gave myself an hour to complete, from scratch no interwebs. Because of the nature of this challenge, the coding style I used was not the best.

## Some changes I would like to add

1) Some kind of User Interface instead of printing to the console
2) A way to add more players maybe up to 4 (this would be interesting). 
   Of course a 3 x 3 wont do for 4 people, but maybe a 5 x 5 grid could be spicy. First to 4 in a row o_O.
3) ~~An AI to play against~~

4) Loot Boxes
5) Unskippable 30 second advertisements
6) Powerups that must be bought from the in game store
