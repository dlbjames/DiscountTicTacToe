# DiscountTicTacToe
A programming challenge I gave myself an hour to complete, from scratch no interwebs. Because of the nature of this challenge, the coding style I used was not the best.

## Some changes I would like to add

1) Some kind of User Interface instead of printing to the console
2) A way to add more players maybe up to 4 (this would be interesting)
3) An AI to play against

4) Loot Boxes
5) Unskippable 30 second advertisements
6) Powerups that must be bought from the in game store
